# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design
<p><b>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</b></p>
The client, DriverPass noticed that many people fail their driving tests at the DMV and there is a need for better driver training. DriverPass started their company to provide this type of training for their customers. DriverPass' new system will provide online classes and practice tests and optional on-the-road training.<br>
<br>
<p><b>What did you do particularly well?</b></p>
We worked to identify the system needs, users and requirements of the system needed resourced from an interview transcipt between the client and our team. The communication was used to identify the clients needs and how we planned to meet those needs in designing and developing the system to include system components and design, nonfunctional and functional requirements, assumptions and limitations.<br>
<br>
<p><b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b></p>
I would spend more time developing more invested design diagrams to correctly portray the targeted goals for the project and system design.<br>
<br>
<p><b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b></p>
Users and their needs would include:<br>
<b>IT/Developer/Analyst</b> (full control) – System Updates, Add/Remove Modules or New Features<br>
<b>Admins</b> (full control of user features/controls) – Generate/Download Reports and Tracking Logs, Add/Change/Modify Users and Permissions/Passwords, Add/Change/Modify Reservations, Disable Packages Offered<br>
<b>Office Staff</b> (limited system access to read, write and modify) - Add/Change/Modify Appointments/Reservations<br>
<b>Online Clients/Students</b> (limited system access to read, write and modify user content) - Add/Change/Modify Client Information/Password, Reservations, View Courses, Online Progress, Driver Notes and Interact with Tests.<br>
<br>
The usability is the benchmark of success for the system. The abiliy of the users to be able to conduct business and generate/manipulate correct input/output and use the system should return the desired outcome of the client's project. <br> 
<br>
<p><b>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</b></p>
<br>First obtain a clear idea of what is requested and or required of the client for the particular design project. Then work to disect those communications into a working plan and set up a schedule to achieve the targeted goals of the project. I feel like diagrams offer a great visual resource to use when designing and building a system.<br>
